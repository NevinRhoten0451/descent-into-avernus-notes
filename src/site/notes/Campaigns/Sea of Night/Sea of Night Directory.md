# Sea of Night Directory
Welcome players to the directory for our one-shot adventure within the Sea of Night. All you need to know about the setting, tone, chracter creation, and more is contained within this directory, so I highly recommend you read through it thoroughly. I have tried my best to keep things as short and simple as I can. This one-shot has the potential to be expanded into a short campaign that I will run alongside Abomination Vaults. We will play one session of this adventure the final week of every month should that occur. Please consider this while creating your characters. I will be running this one-shot on **Jan 14th**.

## The Sea of Night
The Sea of Night is a setting of my creation based heavily off two main sources, the Disney movie Treasure Planet released in 2002 (the year I was born), and the legacy Dungeons and Dragon setting of Spelljammer. Both of these sources are rooted in what I would call 'space fantasy'. Ships don't blast through a lifeless void at light speed, but *sail* through the stars on currents of magical energy. It is not technology that guides the people of the Sea of Night, but arcane magic and the endless desire to explore a vast space ocean filled with planets, nebulas, treasure, and all types of dangerous creatures. The ships that sail the Sea of Night are classic sailing vessels from the Age of Sail bolstered with magical engines that let them travel from star to star. The art presented in this directory should give you a good idea of the feeling and look of this universe, and watching Treasure Planet is practically a window into it, with some of the fundamental elements borrowed from that world.

The Sea of Night itself is the name given to a grand expanse of astral space by it's many inhabitants. Those who sail the Sea of Night seek opportunity, adventure, riches, knowledge, and glory, but all know the expanse is filled with equal parts wonder and danger. 
### The Etherium, The Void, and The Heavenward
The Etherium, known also as the Ether or Aether, is a layer of the Sea of Night that contains breathable air, life, and innumerable celestial bodies that seem to float among the stars like islands. Below the Etherium is the Void, a dark and airless layer. The bravest of sailors don suits to explore or mine rare materials from the region where the Etherium meets the Void, but none go further fore fear of the voidbracken. Sometimes these horrible, unknowable creatures stray from their deep lightless home and terrorize the Etherium above. Should you travel far above the Etherium a sudden and strong gravitational force will pull you back down. This region beyond is called the Heavenward, and is home to the thirteen constellations that make up the Cosmic Caravan, the predominant faith across the civilized stars. Some regions of the Etherium flow quickly enough in a certain direction to form magical currents of energy, and these Ether Currents are often used by ships to quickly travel in the direction the current is flowing, useful for trade, exploration, or moving warships.

## Spellships
Spellships are magically engineered sailing vessels that are used to travel the Sea of Night. They most often resemble highly modified renaissance era ships from the age of exploration outfitted with steampunk esque magical equipment. There will be plenty of spellship art in this directory, so use it to fuel your imagination.

### Spellship Components
In this game there will be no *hard* rules regarding spellships and spellship combat but it will still help to know some of the main components of most spellships before we play. Any good captain knows to keep their ship in good shape, as you depend on it to maneuver through the stars.
#### Arcane Engine 
Magical energy permeates the Etherium and is harnessed by the most important part of a spellship, the arcane engine. the arcane engine is the core of the ship, pulling in, refining, and then channeling the ambient magical energy of the Etherium into propulsion. A mess of pipes, dials, gears, levers, and magical lights, the arcane engine is the heart of the ship beating with life. Wires and steaming pipework are the ships veins, running through the decks and claustrophobic corridors, the engine pumping its energy to every part of the vessel that needs it. Arcane engines are housed below deck in protected chambers where ship engineers and arcanists monitor their stability. They are known to stall, and should a ships drive be destroyed or sabotaged, you can only hope help comes quick, if at all.
#### Beacons
It is not uncommon for sailors to find themselves stranded in the vastness of space with no help in sight due to engine failure or, gods forbid, complete destruction. In the event of such a catastrophe, most ships carry beacons. Beacons typically take the shape of grapefruit sized spheres carved with runes and glyphs. They are kept in the captains quarters behind the captains lock and key. Only a ships captain can order a beacons activation, and for good reason, since the massive magical pulse they emit can be picked up by anyone with the proper magic to detect it. When a ship's captain activates a beacon it's almost always as a last resort since there is no way of knowing who might hear it first. Maybe a friendly merchant vessel will come to your aid, or maybe ruthless and bloodthirsty pirates. The further out in space you travel, the greater the risk. Beacons are expensive and most ships carry only one. A ships chief arcanist can pick up a beacons signal using rudimentary equipment found on nearly every vessel.

#### Gravity Anchor
Since there is no gravity in the vast Etherium ships use gravity anchors to simulate it and make sure sailors don't just float off the deck. Once again, there are no hard rules regarding gravity anchors and what happens if they overlap. The 'radius' of a gravity anchor extends out to the edge of a ship and always pulls down towards the direction of the floor. Should you fall overboard the gravity anchor will not pull you towards the sides of a ship, but keep pulling you down, the momentum of the fall pushing you out of the anchors radius and into zero gravity. Spellships carry large amounts of rope which can be used to pull sailors back on deck. Gravity anchors themselves are partially exposed on the deck of the ship and are of circular design. Contained within a metal shell is essentially a magic centrifuge that rabidly spins, generating artificial gravity. This spinning also generates a subtle hum that sounds through a ship, a hum new sailors despise and old ones can't sleep without. Gravity anchors are powered by a ships arcane engine, so if it goes offline, so does the gravity anchor.
##### Zero Rings
Zero rings, or z-rings, are circular mechanical clips sailors keep on their belts when traveling aboard a spellship. Spellships are designed with plenty of railings and grates where z-rings can be clipped. Z-rings keep sailors from floating off into the stars in the event of gravity anchor failure. Z-rings themselves are often decorated or personalized, with rare materials used to show status or affiliation.

## Lore
This is a one-shot, so I'm going to restrict myself when it comes to the amount of lore I write here. Keep it simple and don't worry yourselves too much about this stuff. It is nice to know, but things can always be explained in the game itself.
### Origins of the Sea of Night
While many myths seek to explain why the etherium that makes the Sea of Night navigable exists, a prominent one claims eons ago a powerful god of air and exploration died, it's body vanishing and soul lingering as the etherium. Scholars do not know the true size of the Sea of Night or where the etheriums outer edges may be, some theorizing it may be infinite.

### The Progenitors 
Old ruins and manuscripts tell of an ancient people who dwelled in the Sea of Night known now as the Progenitors. Scholars, with what little information they have, tell of a people with advanced technology, terraforming capabilities, and great knowledge of the stars. None know what happened to them, but as explorers delve into dangerous Progenitor ruins more is being discovered about their language, magic, and age old secrets. Some arcanists claim that the technology used in arcane engines was somehow gifted to the people of the Sea of Night by the Progenitors before they vanished.

### The Commonwealth
Formed over 300 years ago, the Commonwealth is a collection of planets and systems that essentially act as city states who have all agreed to follow the same laws and codes in the name of greater prosperity. The center of the Commonwealth and it's cultural hub is The Citadel, a massive ring world built out of a Progenitor ruin. While the Commonwealth is of human creation, many other species and people of the Sea of Night call it their home and are welcome to participate in its vast governance. There are thousands of planets in the Commonwealth and it's emblem is a rolled up map pierced by a downward pointing sword. The general aesthetic of the Commonwealth is that of a romanticized industrial England with prominent steampunk elements.

Keeping with this inspiration, the Citadel is ruled by King Silas Hecarim IV, but a parliament keeps his power in check. The Royal Navy keeps order in the Commonwealth by patrolling trade routs and escorting nobles between systems. Only once, Thirty years ago, did the Commonwealth have to mobilize for war, and it was forever changed afterwards.

### The Ten Years War
The Glimmersea is one of the most beautiful and tantalizing regions of the Sea of Night, but much like an anglerfish, its light can lure you into great danger. Of all the known starscapes the Glimmersea attracts a much higher volume of voidbracken monsters up from their dark home and into the etherium. For decades rumors abounded over whether any great civilizations dwelled in the Glimmersea and of what their nature could be. Sailors who were lucky enough to return from it's depths spoke of strange ships stalking them through the stars and odd voices emanating from swirling nebulas. Thirty years ago, these rumors came true.

The Synlirii, or Voiceless Ones, emerged from the Glimmersea on fleets of biological ships known as nautiloids. They ravaged the frontier colonies of the Commonwealth in a wave of swift and sudden destruction never seen before. The Synlirii legions were led by Lord Syuul, and to this day their true goal is still unknown, although theories abound. An alliance of the Commonwealth, the astral elves of Arcadia, and the dwarves of the Eternal Bastion defended the stars from this looming threat, but it only seemed a matter of time before their victory was secured.

### The Battle of Ceres III
Ten years into the war the front had been pushed back to Montressor, which had been outfitted as the Commonwealths last bastion against the Voiceless Ones. The stars between it and the Glimmersea were a no man's land of death and terror, those left living in constant fear of invasion. One planet, Ceres III, homeworld of the Hippotam people, was within this dread zone. The Hippotam people had long been expert weapons engineers, manufacturing and even inventing projectile weapons common across all the Commonwealth and beyond. Because of this, their home planet became the target for a weapon of mass destruction the Synlirii used once, and hopefully never again, the void seed. 

A great purple streak of light crashed into Ceres III creating a void scar of volatile energy that spread from the impact zone. This marked the start of the Battle of Ceres III, as Synlirii nautiloids surrounded the planet and evacuation was ordered. The sky over Ceres III surged with war and the void scar grew larger by the hour, eventually releasing a terrible plague that tore through the entire planet. As the final ships left, the void scar collapsed in on itself, swallowing Ceres III. Just as the planet was lost, the Synlirii flagship, Lucent Edict, was dealt a decisive blow by the combined forces of the Commonwealth alliance. Wounded, but not destroyed, Lord Syuul and the Voiceless One's retreated back to the Glimmersea.

With a planet killer in the hands of the Voiceless Ones the post war Commonwealth has begun to rebuild and grow it's military in preparation of another invasion. All across the stars people prepare for another war, but none know when, or if, it will come. The warzone between the Commonwealth and Glimmersea is now known as the Graveyard and few dare venture inside it. Now, it has been twenty years since the Ten Years War came to a close, and life for many has returned to relative normalcy.
### The Rock of Bral
On the outskirt border of the Commonwealth, where law and order are merely a suggestion, is the outpost known as the Rock of Bral. This asteroid city, somehow or another, has become your home. The Rock, as most prefer to call it, is a haven for all types of folk from the Sea of Night and a central trade hub.

> [!poem] A Royal Navy fleet arrives at the docks of the Rock, drawing many eyes.

The Rock traces its roots back to roughly 170 years ago, when the eponymous Captain Bral established a pirate refuge here. The asteroid became a haven for thieves and cutthroats, and among them a few merchants and entrepreneurs set up shop. Even in a climate of lawlessness, the place evolved into something resembling a settlement of citizens. After Captain Bral’s death, the burgeoning city became known as Bral, in his honor, and its location as the Rock of Bral. For the next several decades, various pirate captains held sway in the city, but none of them demonstrated an interest in trying to take over sole leadership.

Eventually, the merchants and tavernkeepers who made their livings on the Rock became as numerous as the pirates and brigands who sought refuge there. One of the pirate captains, Cozar, sensed that times were changing on the Rock—that the days of lawlessness were coming to an end. Through a series of strategic alliances and shrewd business deals, he consolidated his political power and dubbed himself Prince Cozar, the Rock’s first overlord. Under Prince Cozar’s long reign, the city evolved from a pirate hideout into a major city, attracting profit-seekers, adventurers, and other more respectable types.

Upon Cozar’s death, the rule of Bral passed to Frun, his son and heir. Frun was far from an able politician. Rather, he was a hedonist whose overindulgences compromised his authority. Business leaders and other influential types grabbed power where they could, and by the end of his reign, Frun was little more than a figurehead. His only notable accomplishments were the renovation of the royal palace and the construction of the arena that bears his name.

Frun was succeeded by his son, Calar, whose bearing and tastes resembled those of his father but whose time as the overlord lasted only days. Calar died six years ago under mysterious circumstances shortly after taking the throne; his body was found floating in space. Leadership of the Rock passed to Calar’s younger brother, Andru, who had a group of malcontents arrested and executed for the crime within days.
### Life on the Rock
Bral is populated by an outlandish collection of traders, rogues, mercenaries, pirates, nobles, and entrepreneurs. Generally, law enforcement is sporadic, which means that order is an elusive concept. Most folks who call the Rock home adhere to two principles: mind your own business whenever possible, and enough gold can fix anything.
#### Keeping Order
General lawlessness prevails in much of the city, but that’s not to say that order doesn’t exist. Simply put, most citizens police themselves. No city watch patrols the streets. Tavernkeepers hire muscular folks to break up fights and toss out drunkards. Market vendors trust their own eyes to spot shoplifters. Every person on the Rock is expected to have enough sense to hang onto their purse and not be taken in by a swindler.

Serious crimes, such as arson, can be reported to one of the city’s magistrates If the magistrate concludes that the situation warrants their attention, the Magistrate’s Watch is dispatched to investigate and take offenders into custody, if necessary.

Reporting crimes is voluntary, and many folks don’t bother to do so, since the resulting investigation and legal proceedings are likely to take up too much of their time.

### Cosmic Caravan
The Cosmic Caravan is a zodiac containing thirteen constellations that is worshipped as a collection of thirteen deities by many across the Sea of Night. While it is far from the only faith in the stars, it is by far the most widely accepted and most popular. These constellations lie beyond the Etherium within the Heavenward. 
 - The Thrush: As the first constellation of the year, the Thrush is seen as a herald of the other signs, welcoming them with open wings.
- The Lantern Bearer: The serpentine angel known as the Lantern Bearer guides the other signs, protecting them from danger and monotony.
- The Newlyweds: The Newlyweds are represented as an intertwined couple or scarves that slip away for privacy. They are symbols of devotion and new life.
- The Bridge: The constellation of the Bridge carries the travelers of the Cosmic Caravan over danger and toward new adventure.
- The Daughter: The Daughter is a light-hearted dancer and the first to cross the Bridge into warmth.
- The Rider: The Rider is the guardian of the Cosmic Caravan who watches over his companions mounted on his painted steed. He is seen as either a stern barbarian or a boisterous reveler.
- The Patriarch: Seen as the father of the Cosmic Caravan, the Patriarch guides the Wagon through danger.
- The Wagon: The Wagon  carries the other signs across the sky, and is seen as either a wheel with seven spokes or a seven-pointed star.
- The Pack: The beasts of the Pack follow the Wagon and are seen as either loyal hounds or scavenging wolves.
- The Mother: Seen as a cauldron over a warm fire, the Mother provides comfort and sustenance against chill and is the spiritual heart of the Cosmic Caravan.
- The Stargazer: The Stargazer, sometimes written "Star Gazer", is thought of as either a fool or a prophet who watches the heavens, searching for lost treasures or new wonders.
- The Stranger: The Stranger travels his own path that occasionally intersects with that of the Cosmic Caravan, and is depicted as a single staring eye.
- The Follower: The Follower travels behind the Caravan and can only be seen from the darkest regions of the Sea of Night. He is a veiled figure that represents what awaits all at the end of our journeys: Death.

### Automaton
The spark of life is a strange thing indeed, a spark that can be harnessed, focused, manufactured, and created. None know where the many sentient automatons of the Sea of Night hail from, not even themselves, but they are not uncommon sights in the cities of the stars. Some believe they are creations of the Progenitors that were somehow given new life, others posit they may be ancient creations of reclusive gnomes, seeing as many automatons are designed in their image, and still many claim automatons are simply machines that were gifted life when the etherium was born.

### Hippotam
The hippotam people trace their origins to the planet Ceres III and are relatively recent adopters of spellship technology, having done so close to the forming of the Commonwealth 300 years ago. Quickly they spread through the Sea of Night to become a common people across the stars. Hippotam are tall, broad-shouldered folk with hippo-like features. Some have smooth skin, while others have short bristles on their faces and the tops of their heads. As beings of impressive size and unforgettable appearance, hippotam are noticed wherever they go. They put their great size to use in all sorts of ways, from lifting heavy loads and tying tight knots to opening stuck doors and seeing over crowds. They’re also natural swimmers. Curiously, the hippotam people have an acute affinity with firearms, being natural engineers and marksman. Due to this they were quickly adopted into Commonwealth culture as valued members of society.

### Gith
The gith are a race that have had to fight for survival every step of the way. Their history tells of an incredible escape from the void where their ancient ancestors were subject to strange magic which altered their bodies and minds. This magic now runs in their blood and the gith have forms warped and twisted by an elder touch of the void, some in minor ways, such as an odd eye here and there or extra finger, while others possess two faces or completely new appendages. Most Gith dwell in a city built out of the dead husk of the goddess Tu'narath, the goddess their legends claim shepherded them from the void. Their civilization is one of martial meritocracy, where the better a warrior one is the higher a station in society they hold. Worshipping their queen Saresa like a living deity, they take to the stars on warships and the backs of red dragons to pillage and plunder. Many gith seek lives not dominated by strife, and strike out from their homes in Githspace to travel the stars, while many others take to the life of a pirate or mercenary.
