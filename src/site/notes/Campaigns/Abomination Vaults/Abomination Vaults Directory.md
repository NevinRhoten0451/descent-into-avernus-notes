# Abomination Vaults Directory
Welcome players to the directory for our next campaign, Abomination Vaults! Before I get into the details of this dangerous, mysterious, and perilous adventure, there are some things I need to explain and clear up. As always, I appreciate those of you who really read through these things and consider what I have to say. Keep in mind that much of this was written a fair amount of time ago, but still should apply to the present.

## Fixation
This next campaign will not be what I have told you for many weeks now, that being Descent Into Avernus. That might come as a surprise, or it might not, but regardless, I feel I need to explain myself and the reasons why I am going along with Pathfinder 2nd Edition, which was my plan from the start, a plan I abandoned due to fixation. 

As my two roommates likely are used to by now, when it comes to table top role playing games, I tend to hyper fixate, jumping from one such fixation to another. I think I have discovered why I do this with tabletop role playing material in particular. Because I want to play it all! I want to show you guys all these epic and grand adventures, delight you with compelling characters, worlds, and combat, and most of all, tell all these great stories, but time is a commodity, and I must pick wisely which stories I tell and what format I use to tell them. 
#### Dungeons And Disappointment
Dungeons and Dragons will always have a special place in my heart, and I think the same can be said for many of you, but my god, If I wanted to I could go Martin Luther and give my Ninety-five Theses on the problems with this system. Now, as players, it may be difficult to empathize with the struggle I have with this system, but I can assure you, it's a struggle. Here are a few things, from petty annoyances to game shattering design, that consistently pain me in this game.

- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Martial Caster Divide:</mark> Casters get variety, they get power, and they get game altering and often times encounter shattering abilities that can easily undermine and trivialize narrative. Some of that would be okay if martials were also similarly powerful, but no, they are not. They have a fraction of the variety and a fraction of the power, almost laughably so in the Dungeons and Dragons community. Martial classes get very little love in this system, which is a shame considering Ranger and Rouge are two of my more liked classes. 
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Vague Rules and Even Vaguer Writing:</mark> Dungeons and Dragons is practically famous for the hundreds of different ways a single rule can be interpreted. This is due to the designers using often inconsistent verbiage and different descriptions to convey the same ruling, which can lead to confusion. This has not been helped by the new rules which have small changes to rules descriptions that DRASTICALLY alter how said ability works, inevitably leading to confusion and an endless dive down a thread of similarly confused nerds until stumbling upon something that *kinda* makes *enough* sense. 
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Challenge Rating:</mark> Challenge rating is a broken system that has never worked for encounter balancing. They had the chance to fix this with the new rules and DID NOT. Wanna know if this encounter or string of encounters is going to be a TPK or a cake walk? Beats me buddy how am I supposed to know.
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">The Adventuring Day:</mark> Dungeons and Dragons is balanced around a concept called 'the adventuring day.' The party is supposed to go through a specific amount of encounters in a single day and use their resources over time. Fundamentally, the game expects the party to have expended a certain amount of their resources before fighting a powerful enemy. This means that if I want to have you fight a powerful enemy, first you have to fight his minions for a few hours if I want the encounter to be even remotely challenging. Sometimes this works, oftentimes it doesn't, leading to what should be dramatic encounters falling completely flat because the party has full access to all their powerful tools. You would be amazed at how common it is for new dungeon masters to not understand this. It is not an intuitive system and it is not taught well at all. 
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Monster Design:</mark> It would be an exaggeration to claim that there are no fun monsters in Dungeons and Dragons, but I think the games monster design is oftentimes severely lacking when it comes to fun mechanics that test more than the number of health potions and healing spells a party has. 
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">RANGER:</mark> You had the chance WOtC, you had the chance to fix this class and you did not! My damage goes from 1d6 to 1d10 for my level 20 CAPSTONE ability! You are joking WOtC, you are joking! I seriously cannot understand what ganja green divine MIT quantum computer grass they were smoking to think that shit was okay.

## Pathfinder
Where do all of these gripes with Dungeons and Dragons inevitably lead me to every time? Pathfinder 2nd Edition. Pathfinder is not a perfect system, but nearly all of the major problems I have with Dungeons and Dragons are remedied or partially remedied in this game. The game is immaculately balanced, with there being almost no character creation options that are either substantially weaker or substantially stronger than others. Wording is consistent and concise, with the Traits system allowing for quick adjudication of rules. Where in Dungeons and Dragons there is ambiguity, in Pathfinder there is specificity. The encounter balancing tools in Pathfinder work perfectly. Easy is easy, medium is medium, hard is hard, and deadly is damn deadly. Unlike Dungeons and Dragons, few resources need to be replenished when resting, encouraging you to use them more often. This also means that encounters are not balanced around each other, each fight is mostly determined not by what you have used, but by how you decide to use it now. Ranger is **good** in Pathfinder. 

I hope that all of you will embrace this new system and create some truly unique and fantastic characters within it. Pathfinder is sometimes called a character builders dream, as you can truly craft nearly any sort of character you can think of. And of course, with a new system comes a new setting.
#### Forgetting the Forgotten Realms
This section might make the least sense, but it's an important facet of why I felt this compulsion to stick with Dungeons and Dragons despite my problems with the system. Fantasy role playing systems are invariably tied to their settings, the worlds they take place in, and this is no different for Dungeons and Dragons, which for a majority of its lifespan has been firmly rooted within the world of the Forgotten Realms, a massive fantasy world created by Ed Greenwood. 

I fell in love with the Forgotten Realms after spending weeks, if not months, absorbing book after book detailing so many aspects of its incredible world. I want to explore the streets of Waterdeep, the philosophy of Sigil, the reaches of the Outer Planes, and the jungles of Chult, but all of these places are built around Dungeons and Dragons. This may seem like a strange aspect to get hung up on, especially since I haven't *really* even run a full campaign in the realms, but as I said, I fell in love with them, and a part of me didn't want to leave them behind. But I know if you love something, sometimes you have to let it go. 

I say all this merely to make it easier to understand why I have flip flopped on this matter so much. I know it must be annoying for me to scream about how cool Pathfinder is, then completely abandon the idea and tell you all we're gonna play Dungeons and Dragons for the next hundred years, and then hop right back on the Pathfinder train.

### Managing Expectations
Before we move on to chracter creation I had one more matter to discuss. The last thing I want to do is create stress for you guys, this game is supposed to be a fun way of getting everyone together to enjoy a cool story and create cool characters. If any of you ever feel like I have lost sight of that please tell me. Keeping that in mind, table top role playing games of this variety do ask more from you than some other leisure activities, and I must acknowledge that when moving forward. I want to run the best games I can and create lasting memories with all of you.

With all of that said, I don't want to blindside any of you when I introduce some time management elements and guidelines into our future campaigns. With the amount of players at our table, it is important that time be considered, or else the game can drag on and some people might feel like they are ignored. Below will be a few guidelines on how to best manage time, primarily during your turns, that can better help the game move at a good pace. 

- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Turn Timer:</mark> I will be implementing a turn timer that ensures everyone's turn, including the enemies, is managed equally. Since we are all new to Pathfinder and there are bound to be many questions, the time for each turn will be two minutes. Once this time expires, you must either make a decision now on how to finish your turn, or we will move on to the next combatant. I know this can create a lot of potential stress, so the next tips should be considered by those of you who struggle with making decisions on your turn.
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Plan Before Your Turn:</mark> I will be making a concerted effort to announce which players turn comes up next after the current combatant. You can also see this using the initiative tracker. Please use this time to plan ahead what you wish to do on your turn. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">There Is No Perfect Turn:</mark> It is easy to get paralyzed by choice, and in table top role playing games there are many choices to make, but please remember that there is no such thing as a perfect turn. Focus on making quick and concise decisions instead of spending ample time deliberating on what you think are the most optimal ones. I will not punish anyone for small mistakes they make during most encounters. For high stakes encounters I may even increase the timer so you can think longer on your turn. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Keep Flavor To A Minimum:</mark> I love it when you guys add flavor to your characters actions, but it's important to know when that no longer becomes necessary. Perhaps the first time you cast a spell or do a unique action you can describe the flourish, but every time after that it becomes less needed and can prolong a turn.
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Remember When It's Not Your Turn:</mark> It can be be hard to resist wanting to chime in on other peoples turns to posit what you think would be the best course of action, but remember, it is their turn, not yours. Unless the player whose turn it is actively seeks out guidance on their next actions, please try and allow them to make their own choices. Sometimes this behavior can also lead to arguments, which we should always try and avoid. I know that in any team based game, communication is important, but please remember that at the end of the day this is a game and fun should be the first priority. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Know Your Character:</mark> Please take the time to understand what your character can do and what their general role is during combat, exploration, and even social encounters. I know there is a lot of rules in Pathfinder, so if you ever feel overwhelmed or have questions about a feature, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Remember There Are Others At The Table:</mark> It can be easy to get distracted or immersed in the game so much that you forget there are other people waiting to play. Be mindful of your other players.
## What Lies Ahead?
The Abomination Vaults! This adventure is perfect for beginners and experienced players alike and offers a unique dungeon crawl with tons of terrifying monsters to battle and treasure to find. Before I send you off to read the Players Guide however, let's go over some basics of how we will be navigating this new system and the many resources we can use to help us along the way.
#### Character Sheets
As with any tabletop role playing game, you need a character, and that character is defined by their character sheet. DnD Beyond has spoiled us with its relative ease of use and presentation, so we will have to find an alternative digital builder for Pathfinder. Luckily, they do exist, but with some caveats. 
##### Pathbuilder
Pathbuilder 2E is the most common character builder for Pathfinder 2nd Edition. It is completely free, with every character ancestry, class, and feat available for free. Its interface is fairly intuitive and it does a fair degree of the math for you. Overall, while it will take some time to adjust, Pathbuilder 2E is a very serviceable way to create and manage a character for this system, however, it is far better on desktop than a phone, and it isn't available on Apple phones at all. If you have one I would highly recommend bringing a laptop with your character sheet on Pathbuilder 2E to our sessions. If anyone doesn't have a laptop, I have a single one you can use during the game.

Feel free to explore the builder, but understand that it doesn't have any tutorials or guides built in, it is purely a character creator. With this in mind, it might be beneficial to watch or read some guides before jumping in. Feel free to consult me as well. The same goes for the next character creator below.

- [Pathbuilder 2E](https://pathbuilder2e.com/app.html?v=99b)

##### Wanderer's Guide
Wanderer's Guide is another character builder that is available completely free, although some aesthetic features are locked behind a Patreon subscription. In general I consider it more beginner friendly than Pathbuilder. It functions fine on mobile and desktop, but the interface can be quite cluttered on mobile. As with Pathbuilder, I *highly* recommend using a laptop. All in all, it is a good alternative to Pathbuilder 2E. Your choice will ultimately come down to preference as each creator has quirks and peculiar things that might work better in the other. As a rule of thumb, if something isn't working in one creator, try the other.

#### Archives of Nethys
Archives of Nethys is a repository for all gameplay elements of Pathfinder 2E. It is completely FREE and contains *everything* needed mechanically to run a game and create characters. There is A LOT on this website, but don't get overwhelmed if you decide to visit it. Use this website as a tool to clarify rules and features as well as explore different aspects of character creation.

#### Player Guides
Below is a number of resources and videos you can watch at your leisure. This is not required reading or viewing, but I think it best to put these resources here front and center.

- [New Player Curriculum](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn3PApm8tx0c07YnP3Rztn4MX7ztnWuLx)
- [Picking your Class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfTmp26j5Ts)
- [Ronald the Rules Lawyer, Learning Pathfinder 2E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kD_myoY5P4&t=14s) (This guy is one of my favorite creators and makes incredibly informative videos on Pathfinder, but they are very longform. This is an incredibly useful video, but quite long as well.)
- [How It's Played](https://www.youtube.com/@HowItsPlayed) (Short videos on specific mechanics in the game.)
- [Gentlemen DM Beginners' Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/cfhy7v/the_gentlemans_beginners_guide_to_pathfinder/)
- [The Ultimate Newbie Guide to Pathfinder 2nd Edition](http://www.trollishdelver.com/2023/01/the-ultimate-newbie-guide-to-pathfinder.html)
#### Ancestries
As stated in the player's guide you will find below, there are no ancestries (Pathfinder's version of race or species) that would not work in this campaign, however, there are *a lot* of ancestries in Pathfinder, a potentially overwhelming amount, or at least it would be if Pathfinder wasn't so good at organizing things. All of the common (core) ancestries are eligible to play in this campaign. Should you be interested in an uncommon ancestry, consult with me. I am unlikely to allow rare ancestries, but exceptions might be made.

- [Archives of Nethys: Ancestries](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx)

##### Heritages
Heritages are a lot like subraces in Dungeons and Dragons. Think how in Dungeons and Dragons there are high elves and wood elves. In Pathfinder 2E there are ancient elves, wood elves, arctic elves, cave elves, and much more. This option further refines your character.

Versatile heritages are options every ancestry (with exceptions) can pick for their heritage. A human with elven blood would pick human as their race and then select the aiuvarin versatile heritage, aiuvarin being the name for half-elves in this world. An elf could pick the dromaar (half-orc) versatile heritage and play as an elf with orchish blood flowing through their veins. Keep in mind that there are combinations I might not allow. 

Other versatile heritages include nephilim, pathfinders version of both tieflings and aasimar, dragonblood, folk with draconic lineage, and dhampir, mortal offspring of vampires. 

- [Archives of Nethys: Versatile Heritages](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?Versatile=true)
#### Classes
There are a lot of classes in Pathfinder 2E and many of them share names with those in Dungeons and Dragons, but they do not all function or play the same. Since this is our first game of Pathfinder, I will be slightly restricting class choices to ensure no one chooses some of the more advanced and complicated classes, save Alchemist and Wizard. Note that despite this restriction the total number of player classes available is larger than Dungeons and Dragons. These classes are: 

> [!poem] Alchemist, Barbarian, Fighter, Rouge, Swashbuckler, Champion, Monk, Ranger, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Witch, Wizard.

- [Class Summaries](https://imgur.com/LjllYua) (This is a useful summary of the different classes. Consider this information when picking your class. Note than in Pathfinder casters, as well as the Alchemist class, are generally more complicated to play well than martial classes, requiring a fair degree of strategy, so consider that when picking. If you are curious or nervous about playing as a caster, consider watching this video: [HOW TO CASTER GOOD in Pathfinder 2e (Spellcasting Strategy Guide)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHXVZ3l7YvA))

## Abomination Vaults 
One of the most well designed aspects of Pathfinder 2E are its adventures, mainly do in part to the Player's Guides created for each adventure path made for the game. Instead of asking the DM to design an entire write up to deliver the players in order to fit their characters into the campaign, Pathfinder adventures have it all prepared. Below is the link to the Abomination Vaults Player's Guide. It contains all the relevant information you and your characters need to know in order to make a character for this campaign. Read it carefully and please consider integrating your character into the world by giving them some attachment to the town of Otari and using the Backgrounds provided in the guide. 

- [Abomination Player's Guide:](https://paizo.com/blog/a-light-in-the-fog-abomination-vaults-player-s-guide) (Scroll down and click 'Download the Abomination Vaults Player's Guide!')
### Character Story Integration
If you are want a quick way of integrating your character into the story of Abomination Vaults and want them to have a strong motivation to explore the dangers of Gauntlight, consider having them hail from the town of Otari itself and using one of the backgrounds provided in the Player's Guide. Your character need not have lived in Otari all their life, but as their first home, they would have plenty reason to want to defend it from monstrous threats.
