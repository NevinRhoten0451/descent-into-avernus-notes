# Player Directory
Welcome adventurers to our next campaign, and my last campaign running 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons. I'm sure some of you might be surprised, considering I have a great desire to run Pathfinder 2nd Edition, but for a long time I have known there is one last story I want to in this system. Welcome to Descent Into Avernus. 

## Campaign Overview
Descent Into Avernus is a story of epic and heroic fantasy where you will take on the role of an established adventurer in the city of Elturel within the world of the Forgotten Realms. Be you a denizen of the city or passing through, you already posses a great deal of power and renown in the adventuring world. Our campaign will begin at level 4 and end at level 13,  so 9 levels of progression in total. 

All seems well and good within the holy city of Elturel, capital of the country of Elturgard, but when cataclysm strikes and the city seems doomed it will fall upon you to be its defenders, and perhaps even its saviors. Know this however, it won't be easy.

## Campaign Themes
While I cannot reveal too much for obvious risks of spoilers, consider the broad themes of this campaign when creating your character using the guidelines below. 
- ### Fall From Grace
	How does one bathed in the light fall into the darkness. Will they embrace their new self or strive to reclaim what has been lost?
- ### Redemption
	The strongest theme within this campaign by far. What must a person do, what must they confront, and what must they restore to be redeemed? Are they worthy of redemption at all? You should be asking yourself this question throughout this adventure. Perhaps your character has something they regret, something they wish they could find redemption for?
- ### Into the Heart of Darkness
	This adventure will take your characters to places and have them interact with things far beyond the material realm. Consider how your character might react to the unprecedented situation they are going to find themselves in. Will it be too much? 

# Character Creation
We will be using the 2024 ruleset for character creation and I highly encourage you to choose options from the new rules, although it is not required. As you have all seen, I do not adhere strictly to the rules 100% of the time. As a dungeon master it is my job to create a fun, dramatic, and tense story driven game. Sometimes the rules can actually get in the way of this, and I believe I have proved to all of you that I have your best interests in mind, so when I change things of adjust things, please be patient and understand that Dungeons & Dragons is far from a perfect system. 

## Gameplay
This adventure focuses heavily on combat and exploration in a dangerous, strange, and hostile realm beyond what your characters may understand. Focus on creating a character who is competent in battle first and foremost. As with all adventures there will still be plenty of social interactions and role play, but expect conflict the be resolved in battle, not in negotiation, although that doesn't mean you should never try, you might be surprised how far you can get with words.

## Class
I will keep and updated list of what classes each of you has chosen below. When you alert me as to your class, I will consider that locked in. Each of you must play a different class. Should you change your mind or have conflicts regarding who gets to play what, please work that out with each other. I know many of you were thinking about your Pathfinder 2nd Edition characters, so consider retooling them for this campaign or creating a whole new concept with these guidelines in mind. I will not be allowing classes like Bloodhunter and the Artificer does not fit within the fantasy of this campaign. No Eli you cannot play paladin sorry. 
- ##### Jasper: ?
- ##### Jared: Paladin
- ##### Xane: ?
- ##### Barbos: ?
- ##### Amy: ?
- ##### Eli: ?

Remember that this adventure begins at level 4, so consider what achievements your character already has within the archetype of their class and how that might affect their story. You character will also begin the game with 1 uncommon magic item of you choice that I allow. Consider tying this item into their story or journey in some way. Perhaps it was a gift from a family member or adventuring patron, or a souvenir form their first adventure? Don't pick anything from setting specific sources please, look in the Dungeon Masters Guide and other non setting specific sources.

## Class Concepts and Recommendations

Below is a list of potential story concepts for each class within this campaign. Consider these when creating your character and story, as they allow you to fit within the narrative of this campaign in interesting ways. These are not ideas you must use, but as with other details I will present later, I highly recommend you consider using these or redesigning them slightly to fit a character concept you may already have.

I will give scores to these classes, subclasses, and story concepts based on how well I think the fit into the campaign. Don't treat these as gospel, but consider them when making your character.

> [!infobox] Disclaimer: This adventure is a work of fiction aimed at providing you and your friends with many hours of fantastic entertainment. Although devils and the Nine Hells play prominent roles in this story, the evil they represent is meant to be fought and overcome. Wizards of the Coast fully endorses the kicking of evilâ€™s butt. Let darkness fall and light prevail! We strongly advise that you not play this adventure backward, lest Asmodeus appear in a puff of smoke to talk politics, as archfiends are wont to do.
